            <p>I categorizes users into villagers who participate in activities and health-carer who plan activities.
                The average age of the villagers is 70+, and the past platform lacks "sorting" feature and personal
                activities management feature. And also they are not good at network, it leads to <b>bad user
                    experience such as registration and searching difficulties.</b> However, the health-carer needs to
                manage
                and plan activities. <b>In the past, the whole data records on paper</b>, which made it
                difficult to manage activities. Therefore, it's a burden to make health-carer analyze what new
                activities should be
                held or optimized difficultly.</p>

            <h4>Find-Outs</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Hard-to-Find Info:</b> In most cases, paper records are used, such as: roll call, activity
                    content, which often makes the information difficult to find and keep. Therefore, they often rely on
                    rules of thumb to plan activities, and even help villagers to manually register for activities to
                    add extra work pressure.</li>
                <li><b>The Wrong Platform:</b> There are also some activities that use the online platform to register,
                    but the most of villagers are not familiar with network, so they will ask staff to assist in
                    registration. Some elders don’t even use the platform, so they call the counter directly and ask the
                    staff to help them join the activity by using background. It makes the original convenience to
                    become a burden instead.</li>
                <li><b>No Place to Remind:</b> If there is a temporary difficulty in the activity to make the location
                    or time should be changed, the news is announced on the official website. However, the villagers do
                    not use the Internet frequently, there's something problems will happened, such as losing
                    information and going to the wrong classroom.</li>

                the design specifications of the APP for the seniors, meeting with staff of health village to build
                dialogue scripts, and following with the Find-Outs above, I have
                come to the conclusions, Here's the following main points:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Clear:</b> High contrast color, Big word, Big icon with name...</li>
                <li><b>Bright & Energy:</b> High saturation color, friendly text...</li>

        <!-- final design 2 -->
        <div>
            <p>My first step is to set the brand color first, because it is an activity platform, I hope to have a sense
                of vitality, and then refer to the above main points to complete the UI design specifications, and
                finally we complete, Let's check it out!</p>

                <p>Because of time, I couldn't participate in the next iteration, so I recorded the entire design and
                    research journey, and also built a flow chart for the engineers. I completed a HAPPY BOOK to collect
                    them recently, and Here's the book:</p>

            <h4>The first whole project</h4>
            <p>Unlike designing a function of product, I need to understand the entire product journey, the health village, the seniors, the stakeholders, and even myself. That is to say, it's my graduation project and a business project at the same time. I have to make unique ideas on the premise of actual launch. Therefore, it can't be avoid that interesting ideas will be threw. My goal is to find a balance between uniqueness and consistency.

        <!-- takeaway 2 -->
        <div>
            <h4>The challenges of designing at scale</h4>
            <p>In the past, I completed school projects by myself or in cooperation with classmates that as a designer. This time, I cooperated with a complete team. Unlike before, there are many constraints on cooperative design, such as: the brand concept of the customer, the persistence of stakeholders, the engineering team's limit. It takes a lot of time and effort to understand their requirements and reach alignment. There were also emergencies in the development, the product was redesigned, and it was a thrilling but perfect ending experience.
