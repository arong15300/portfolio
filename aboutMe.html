        <p>Hi, I’m 王俊鎔, a UX designer. Or, you can just call me Aaron, read as my Taiwanese nickname. I majored in
          Industrial Design. I've been dedicated to design journey at least 4 years, begin from the time I just get into
          the university. Since that, I've loved to jump outside my comfort zone. As people say, “ If you don’t give it
          a try, you’ll never know”. In 2019 summer vacation, I had a working holiday in 小琉球, an island which is part of
          Taiwan, for 4 weeks. I met a lot of new friends who also was in a working holiday. The more I see, the more
          I'll know. Because of the journey, I find out that I love to making people happy. I'm a happy guy in a group.
          I want know more different kinds of people. Now, I'm still keeping create new life experience, and trying
          apply it to design, and strives to be a empathetic guy who likes to try something new.</p>

        <p>Through internships, online courses, and participation in offline activities, 3 core skills of UX designers
          have been developed:</p>
      </div>

      <!--  -->
      <div>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h4>Communication skills:</h4> Due to the curriculum arrangement of the department, persuading listeners to
            accept
            my design concepts, listening to teachers' suggestions and improve, has become a common practice. I have
            participated in national innovation and entrepreneurship competitions and organized a team to design
            products and business models. And also in the graduation project, I cooperate with 2 designers, 3 design
            professors, 2 engineering professors, the field which we cooperate with, and engineering teams to coordinate
            the development of the "Learning Platform for Senior Citizens" and it will actually land in Chang Gung
            Health Culture Village in the future.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Leadership:</h4> Due to my interest in public welfare and humanities, I have served as a charge of the
            regional
            alumni association and led about 20 active members through my 2-year participation in the school club.
            During my tenure, my team held a care activity for rural primary schools, which prepared 6-month and
            affected about 100 schoolchildren. And also held 5 school-wide activities, increasing the number of members
            by 10%.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Open-mindedness:</h4> Due to the enthusiasm for exploring new things, through various part-time work
            experiences, understanding various customers from the service industry, and understanding the concept of
            "beauty" in photos from children's activity photography, I also resolutely went to 小琉球, an island of Taiwan,
            alone. For a month of work for dorm exchange, learn housekeeping and free diving, and have a deep
            understanding of the unique local culture. Getting in touch with many people, and getting to know diverse
            people, is also more able to accept different voices and suggestions.
          </li>
