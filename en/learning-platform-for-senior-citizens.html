            <h4>User Problem</h4>
            <p>I categorizes users into villagers who participate in activities and health-carer who plan activities.
                The average age of the villagers is 70+, and the past platform lacks "sorting" feature and the activity
                information is fragmented. They are also not good at network. It leads to <b>bad user
                    experience such as registration and searching difficulties.</b> However, the health-carer needs to
                manage
                and plan activities. <b>In the past, the whole data records on paper</b>, which made it
                difficult to manage activities. Therefore, it's a burden to make health-carer analyze what new
                activities should be
                held or optimized difficultly.</p>
        </div>

            <h4>The Goal</h4>
            <p>I’d like to create something that can solve user problem. It comes down to
                the following three aspects:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Unified:</b> Unify fragmented activity information across Health Village in familiar platform
                </li>
                <li><b>Accessible:</b> Users should be guided through their task goals</li>

            <h2>Personalized Recommendations Help Make Decisions</h2>
            <p>Through empathize users, we understand that the seniors are not good at using the Internet, and it is
                difficult for them to search. Therefore, we have designed Personalized Activity Recommendations and
                analyzed the users' past activity records to provide the most suitable activities and interested
                activities. It can meet the needs of users and meet the design goal, promote the activity participation
                rate.</p>

            <h2>The Right Platform Uses More Smoothly</h2>
            <p>We found that most platforms use web pages for basic functional
                operations, we also found that they use the group function in the <b>LINE APP for message
                    communication</b>, so I searched and found that: <a
                    href="https://www.iii.org.tw/Press/NewsDtl.aspx?nsp_sqno=1917&fm_sqno=14" target="_blank"> 60%
                    of the seniors(over 55) have a smartphone, and more than 90% of them use the LINE APP.</a> By
                asking the staff of the health care village, we learned that more than 70% of the seniors in the
                village have a smartphone, and nearly 100% of them use the LINE APP , and the villagers are more
                familiar with mobile phones than the other seniors.</p>

            <h2>Online Activity History Makes The Next Activity Better</h2>
            <p>In the past, paper were used to record activities, which often made it difficult to review. Therefore, we
                created several functions and made them online through empathy users. These records can give health
                carers more basis for planning activities.</p>

            <h4>Find-Outs</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Hard-to-Find Info:</b> In most cases, paper records are used, such as: roll call, activity
                    content, which often makes the information difficult to find and keep. Therefore, they often rely on
                    rules of thumb to plan activities, and even help villagers to manually register for activities to
                    add extra work pressure.</li>
                <li><b>The Wrong Platform:</b> There are also some activities that use the online platform to register,
                    but the most of villagers are not familiar with network, so they will ask staff to assist in
                    registration. Some elders don’t even use the platform, so they call the counter directly and ask the
                    staff to help them join the activity by using background. It makes the original convenience to
                    become a burden instead.</li>
                <li><b>No Place to Remind:</b> If there is a temporary difficulty in the activity to make the location
                    or time should be changed, the news is announced on the official website. However, the villagers do
                    not use the Internet frequently, there's something problems will happened, such as losing
                    information and going to the wrong classroom.</li>

                dialogue scripts, and following with the Find-Outs above, I have
                come to the conclusions, Here's the following main points:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Clear:</b> High contrast color, Big word, Big icon with name...</li>

            <p>My first step is to set the brand color first, because it is an activity platform, I hope to have a sense
                of vitality, and then refer to the above main points to complete the UI design specifications, and
                finally we complete, Let's check it out!</p>

                <p>LINE still has limitations, and some functions cannot be used like
                    web pages. In the next generation, we will add web page function development and redesign the
                    journey of users. Because of time, I cant't participate in the next iteration, so I make a HAPPY
                    BOOK to record the design journey, and Here's the book:

            <h4>The first whole project</h4>
            <p>Unlike designing a function of product, I need to understand the entire product journey, the health
                village, the seniors, the stakeholders, and even myself. That is to say, it's my graduation project and
                a business project at the same time. I have to make unique ideas on the premise of actual launch.
                Therefore, it can't be avoid that interesting ideas will be threw. My goal is to find a balance between
                uniqueness and consistency.

            <h4>The challenges of designing at scale</h4>
            <p>In the past, I completed school projects by myself or in cooperation with classmates that as a designer.
                This time, I cooperated with a complete team. Unlike before, there are many constraints on cooperative
                design, such as: the brand concept of the customer, the persistence of stakeholders, the engineering
                team's limit. It takes a lot of time and effort to understand their requirements and reach alignment.
                There were also emergencies in the development, the product was redesigned, and it was a thrilling but
                perfect ending experience.
