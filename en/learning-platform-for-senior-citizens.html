                    National Quality mark in 2021</a>. We hope it can encourage senior citizens to participate in activities that will improve their physical and mental health,abilities of the senior citizens, while also reducing the burden on health care providers and providing health data tracking. We hope that after some time, if the platform proves successful, it can be implemented in society and provide a national registration system for senior citizens to indirectly improve their health and reduce their pain from diseases.

        <div>
            <h4>User Problem</h4>
            <p>To improve user experience, I've categorized our users into two groups: the villagers who participate in the activities, and the health-carers who plan them. The villagers' average age is 70+, and many of them are not tech-savvy, <b>which makes it challenging for them to navigate the platform.</b> In the past, the platform lacked a sorting feature, and the activity information was fragmented, leading to difficulties in registration and searching. On the other hand, <b>the health-carers used to manage and plan activities on paper, making it challenging to keep track of the data and analyze which activities to hold or optimize.</b> This process was burdensome for them.</p>
        </div>

            <h4>The Goal</h4>
            <p>I’d like to create a solution that solves users' problems. It comes down to
                the following three aspects:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Unified:</b> Unify fragmented activity information across Health Village in familiar platform
                </li>
                <li><b>Accessible:</b> Users should be guided through their task goals</li>
                <li><b>Data-based:</b> If users have more questions, they can reach out for the answer</li>

            <p>By empathizing with users, we understand that the seniors are not good at using the Internet making it difficult for them to search. Therefore, we have designed Personalized Activity Recommendations and
                analyzed the users' past activity records to provide activities that are most suitable and interesting for them. This helps meet user needs, achieve design goals, and increase activity participation rates.</p>

            <h2>The Right Platform Uses More Smoothly</h2>
            <p>We've discovered that most platforms utilize web pages for basic functionality, while <b>LINE APP's group feature is utilized for message communication.</b> Further research indicates that: <a
                    href="https://www.iii.org.tw/Press/NewsDtl.aspx?nsp_sqno=1917&fm_sqno=14" target="_blank">60% of seniors over the age of 55 own a smartphone, with over 90% of them using the LINE APP.</a> Additionally, after speaking with staff at the health care village, we found that over 70% of the seniors there own a smartphone, and nearly 100% of them use the LINE APP. It's also worth noting that the village seniors are more familiar with mobile phones than other seniors.</p>

            <p>In the past, activities were recorded on paper, making it difficult to review them later. Therefore, we
                created several online functions and address this issue through empathizing with users. These records provide health
                carers with a more solid foundation for planning future activities.</p>

            <h4>Find-Outs</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Challenges with Information Management:</b> In most cases, paper-based records such as attendance records and activity content are used, making it difficult to organize and access information. As a result, health village staff often rely on less efficient methods to plan activities and may manually register villagers for activities, leading to an increased workload.</li>
                <li><b>The Wrong Platform:</b> There are also some activities that use the online platform to register,
                    but most of the villagers are not familiar with network, so they will ask staff to assist in
                    registration. Some elders don’t even use the platform, so they call the counter directly and ask the
                    staff to help them join the activity by using the system's backend. It makes the original convenience to
                    become a burden instead.</li>
                <li><b>No Place to Remind:</b> When there are changes in location or time for an activity, the news is announced on the official website. However, since the villagers don't frequently use the internet, they may miss the information and end up going to the wrong location. Therefore, a platform with push notifications or other forms of reminders should be considered to keep villagers informed of any changes in activity schedules.</li>

            <p>Based on the results of user interviews and team meetings, it was decided to create 3 different Personas. <b>The primary personas consist of two main types</b>: active villagers who frequently participate in activities and introverted villagers who are less likely to participate. <b>The secondary persona</b> represents the staff of the activity department. With these personas established, we can now proceed to the User Journey Map.</p>

                <li><b>Users seek guidance:</b> When they lost in the platform, they prefer to have a guidance that can help them achieve their goals, rather than having to repeatedly seek help from others.</li>
                <li><b>Users want to track their activities:</b> Activity need to be recorded to avoid forgetting. For
                    the villagers, they desire someone can remind them to participate in the activity; For the staff, recording the seniors' activity process is valuable for analysis.</li>

            <h4>FINAL DESIGN</h4>
            <p>We have designed the UI of the front-stage, with a focus on the main users, the villagers. To align the user's needs, I have studied the design specifications of the the senior-friendly mobile app, conducted meetings with the staff of health village to create dialogue scripts, and following with the Find-Outs above. As a result, I have come to the conclusions. Here's the following main points:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Clarityr:</b> High contrast colors, Large text, Prominent icons with labels...</li>
                <li><b>Vibrancy & Energy:</b> saturated colors, friendly text...</li>
                <li><b>Easy-to-Understand:</b> Intuitive text...</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        </div>

        <!-- final design 2 -->
        <div>
            <p>My first step was to establish the brand color. Since the platform is an activity platform, it was important to create to create a vibrant and energetic atmosphere. Referring to the main points mentioned earlier, the UI design specifications were then completed. Finally I completed UI design, and let's check it out!</p>

            <h4>The first whole project</h4>
            <p>Unlike designing a specific product function, my graduation project involves understanding the entire product journey, including the health village, the seniors, the stakeholders, and even my own role. In other words, it's both my graduation project and a business project.  I am tasked with generating unique ideas that align with the practical requirements for actual implementation. Therefore, it is inevitable that some interesting ideas may be discarded. My goal is to strike a balance between uniqueness and consistency.

            <h4>The challenges of designing at scale</h4>
            <p>In the past, I used to work on school projects either on my own or with classmates as a designer.
                However, this time, I collaborated with a complete team. Unlike previous experience, collaborative design comes with its own set of constraints, including considerations such as the client's brand concept, the preferences of stakeholders, and the technical limitations of the engineering team.  It takes a lot of time and effort to understand their requirements and reach alignment.
                Additionally, we encountered unexpected challenges during the development process, which necessitated a thorough product redesign. Despite the thrilling, it ultimately resulted in a perfect ending.
