        <p>Hi, I’m 王俊鎔 from Taiwan. You also can just call me Aaron, read as my Taiwanese nickname. I majored in
          Industrial Design and focus on Digital Product Design. I've loved to jump outside my comfort zone and trying new things, as people say, “If you don’t give it
          a try, you’ll never know”.  During the summer vacation of 2019, I had a working
          holiday on 小琉球, a beautiful island in Taiwan, for 4 weeks.  This journey opened my eyes and made me realize that I enjoy making people happy.  I'm also a happy guy who loves to be in a group and learn from different kinds of people.
          Currently, I'm constantly seeking out new life experiences, and applying them to my design.  I strive to be a empathetic guy who always likes to try something new.</p>

        <p>Through internships, online courses, and participation in offline activities, 3 core skills of Product Designers
          have been developed:</p>
      </div>

      <!--  -->
      <div>
        <ol style="font-size:1.5em;">
          <li>
            <h4>Communication skills:</h4><p>Because of the department's curriculum, I learned how to present my design ideas persuasively and listen to feedback from teachers to improve. I have also taken part in national innovation and entrepreneurship competitions, where I led a team to develop products and business models. In my graduation project, I collaborated with two designers, three design professors, two engineering professors, and the field we worked in, along with engineering teams, to create a "Learning Platform for Senior Citizens." This platform is set to launch in Chang Gung Health Culture Village soon.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Leadership:</h4><p>I have always had a passion for public welfare and the humanities. In fact, I was the leader of the regional alumni association and was in charge of 20 active members for two years when I was in school. Together, we organized a care activity for rural primary schools that ran for six months and impacted about 100 schoolchildren. Additionally, we held five school-wide activities which led to an increase of 10% in our membership.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Open-mindedness:</h4><p>I love exploring new things and have gained valuable insights into customer service through various part-time jobs. My experience as a children's activity photographer has also given me a better understanding of the concept of beauty in photos. To further broaden my horizons, I even traveled alone to 小琉球, an island in Taiwan, where I spent a month doing housekeeping, learning about dorm exchange, and even trying out free diving. This experience allowed me to gain a deep appreciation for the unique local culture and connect with many different people. It has also made me more open to accepting diverse voices and suggestions.</p>
