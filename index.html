    <span class="title">ABOUT ME</span>

    <div class="selfIntro">
      <h1>YOU’LL NEVER KNOW<br>JUST GIVE IT A TRY</h1>
      <p>Hi, I’m 王俊鎔, Aaron, a UX designer. Or, you can just call me Aaron, read as my Taiwanese nickname. I have been
        devoted to make people enjoy product at least 4 years, begin from the time I just get into the university. Since
        that, I have loved to break my comfort zone. As people say, “ If you don’t give it a try, you’ll never know”.
        The more I see, the more I’ll know. In 2019 summer vacation, I’ve been to 小琉球, an island which is part of
        Taiwan, alone for 4 weeks. It’s a kind of working holiday, which is work for dorm. During the 4 weeks in 小琉球, I
        met a lot of people and made about 10 more friends who was like me. They always said:”You’re really a such
        open-minded and friendly guy”. And I still remember the day my contract was expired, my boss gaves me bonus and
        said she admired my passion in work. After this experience, I realized a pharse, “Attitude determines your
        height”. Now, I strives to be a humble guy who likes to try something new.</p>

      <div>
        <h2 class="txtBold">COMMUNICATION IS IMPORTANT</h2>
        <p>When I was a fourth-year student,I started my graduate project, 做伙動, a learning platform for senior on LINE,
          the most popular message APP for Taiwanese seniors. The teams I cooperated were the field where the product landing,
          Engineering team, and my professor who is like the team’s supervisor. And my duty was design the whole product
          from 0 to 100. In other words, I should finish background and user research, report to our teams, find the
          best strategy, and design the final product. Even there’s a lot of voice, I still organized and finished my
          project perfectly.</p>

        <h2 class="txtBold">FAST LEARNER</h2>
        <p>After the project, I realized if I don’t know thier language, I will never communicate with them easily. I
          started looking for a course that could make me stronger. Then I found a course to learn HTML5 and CSS that
          could make me know about engineer’s language. Finally, I finished the graduate work for 4 weeks.</p>
